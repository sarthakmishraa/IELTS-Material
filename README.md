The International English Language Testing System (IELTS /ˈaɪ.ɛlts/), is an international standardized test of English language proficiency for non-native English language speakers. Taking the IELTS test opens doors – it can help you study, live or work almost anywhere around the world.

Taking mock tests will help you in your IELTS preperation and which is why I have uploaded 3 IELTS books with audio files.

Each book has 4 mock tests in it so it is enough to start your IELTS preperation 2 weeks before and take these 12 mock tests plus 4 tests from the booklet that you will be getting.
